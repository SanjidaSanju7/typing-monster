                        There are two main types of browser storages: session and local storage. They both have their
                        own unique benefits and drawbacks that are good to understand. <br>
                        Their main difference is that local storage data does not expire, whereas session storage data
                        gets cleared when the user closes its browser window.
                        Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. So, if a user has three tabs open, each one
                        will have its own page session. Since local storage is not session-based, all the data must be
                        deleted via javascript or manually. <br>
                        In conclusion, local storage is best for storing data you want to keep long term, even after the
                        user has closed the tab or browser.
                        Session storage is best for storing temporary data or data that should only be accessible from
                        one tab.

                        JavaScript ES6 has different ways to declare and use variables. This often leds to confusion
                        about when to use which keyword, in this article I have made this easy to figure out when to use
                        which keyword.In order to know which keyword to use we must first know about the scope in
                        javascript.As the name says it 'scope' means which variable is accessible and upto which point
                        it is accessible. So, in javascript the whole document is global scope and all the other
                        functions and variables are contained in this global scope.
                        Another is the Local Scope, variables declared inside the functions are considered to be of the
                        local scope and it is futher divided into function scoped and block scoped.<br>
                        Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that
                        function and cannot be used outside that function.<br>
                        Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while
                        loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables
                        declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope. <br> Coming back to the use
                        of keywords,
                        var is called as function scope that is if a variable is declared using var keyword it will be
                        accessible throughout the function.
                        let & const are also called as block scope that is they are accessible within that particular
                        block. Here let is used for variable which can be changed as we proceed through the program
                        whereas const is used for a variable which does not change till the program ends, that is it
                        remains constant throughout the program.

                        JavaScript is a single-threaded language. In other words, it can do only one thing at a time.
                        JavaScript executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures,
                        gives us the illusion of multi-threading. The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's
                        asynchronous programming.
                        The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the
                        Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to
                        the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.
                        Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
